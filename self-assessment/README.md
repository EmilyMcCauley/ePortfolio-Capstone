## Key Competencies Developed

### Collaboration in a Team Environment

Throughout the program, I have had opportunities to collaborate with my peers on various projects. Working in teams has taught me how to manage diverse ideas, communicate effectively, and find consensus on technical decisions. For instance, in group projects, I learned to leverage each team member's strengths while contributing my own expertise in software design and algorithms. I am comfortable both in leadership roles and as a contributing team member, always aiming to keep communication open and constructive. 

### Communication with Stakeholders

Effective communication is a crucial aspect of any project, and I have honed my ability to articulate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Whether presenting a new algorithm or explaining the design of a database, I’ve developed clear, concise ways to communicate complex ideas. This skill has been particularly useful when presenting my projects to instructors and peers, as I have learned to break down complicated topics into understandable sections, ensuring that stakeholders are on the same page regarding project goals, progress, and outcomes.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

A key focus of my studies has been understanding and applying various data structures and algorithms. Through coursework and my ePortfolio artifacts, I have learned how to optimize code and data handling through efficient algorithms. For instance, in my 3D modeling project, I utilized algorithms to manage complex data and optimize rendering performance. These experiences have deepened my understanding of how algorithms form the backbone of computational efficiency and how the correct data structure can make a significant difference in system performance.

### Software Engineering and Database Design

The Computer Science program has also strengthened my software engineering skills, including the use of version control systems like Git and the application of best practices in software design. My projects have ranged from building software applications with clear architecture and code modularity to implementing full-stack systems. The database application I developed using MongoDB demonstrates my ability to work with NoSQL databases, structuring data to efficiently track students’ grades and course performance. I’ve learned how to create scalable, maintainable databases that support real-time applications.

### Security

Throughout my coursework and in my personal projects, I have gained a fundamental understanding of security principles. From securing data in databases to encrypting sensitive information in software applications, security is always a key consideration. This has inspired me to continually evaluate potential security vulnerabilities in my code and design decisions, ensuring that data protection and ethical guidelines are always followed.
