# Algorithms and Data Structure Artifact Narrative

## Artifact Description
The artifact I selected for this milestone is a 3D modeling project initially created during a previous class. The project utilizes OpenGL to render 3D objects and manage scene components such as camera controls and transformations. While the original project included a basic implementation of the ViewManager class to handle camera movement and user input, it lacked advanced features such as smooth projection switching, dynamic camera speed adjustments, and intuitive user input handling. As part of my enhancement process, I focused on improving these aspects to refine the usability and performance of the project.

## Justification for Inclusion in the ePortfolio
I chose this artifact for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to work with computer graphics concepts that require a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. Enhancing the ViewManager class demonstrates my skills in implementing efficient algorithms for camera navigation and user input processing.

Key improvements include:
- **Smooth Mouse-Driven Camera Movement**: This required designing algorithms to process mouse inputs in real-time and update the camera's position and orientation fluidly.
- **Dynamic Camera Speed Adjustments**: The camera speed now adjusts based on user input, enhancing responsiveness while maintaining consistency with other features.
- **Projection Switching Mechanism**: Implemented matrix operations to toggle between perspective and orthographic views, improving the userâ€™s ability to interact with the 3D scene.

These enhancements illustrate my ability to design and implement efficient algorithms while considering the practical constraints of real-time applications.

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process
Enhancing this artifact provided a valuable learning experience, particularly in the application of algorithms and data structures to real-world challenges.

### Key Learnings:
- **Camera Control Optimization**: I refined the camera movement algorithms to achieve a smooth and natural user experience. This involved iterative testing and fine-tuning to eliminate jerky or slow movements.
- **Balancing Features and Performance**: Implementing dynamic camera speed adjustments required carefully balancing responsiveness with functionality to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Matrix Operations for Projection Switching**: Understanding and applying matrix transformations allowed me to implement an effective projection toggling mechanism, further enhancing the user interface.

### Challenges:
- **Mouse-Driven Camera Movement**: Early versions of the camera controls were either too slow or unresponsive. Iterative refinement and optimization were necessary to achieve a smooth and intuitive experience.
- **Integration of Features**: Ensuring the camera speed adjustments worked in harmony with projection switching and movement controls without introducing inconsistencies required significant attention to detail.

### Course Outcomes Met:
- **Designing and Evaluating Computing Solutions**: The refinement of the ViewManager demonstrates my ability to design solutions that enhance functionality and usability.
- **Algorithmic Problem-Solving**: This artifact reflects my ability to apply advanced algorithms for camera navigation, user input processing, and matrix operations.
- **Real-Time System Optimization**: I demonstrated the use of innovative techniques to address the challenges of real-time graphics applications, improving both performance and user experience.

## Conclusion
The enhancements made to the ViewManager class significantly improved the functionality and usability of my 3D modeling project. This artifact showcases my ability to apply algorithmic principles and data structures to solve real-world problems in interactive applications. It represents a critical component of my ePortfolio, highlighting my technical skills and my growth in designing and optimizing systems. This project is a strong example of my competencies in algorithms and data structures, as well as my ability to address complex challenges in computer science.
