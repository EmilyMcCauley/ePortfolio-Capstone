# Database Artifact Narrative

## Artifact Description
The artifact for this milestone is a database project initially developed during the early stages of my Computer Science degree. The project focused on creating a database to track student grades, courses, and scores. Initially, this database was a foundational exercise in SQL and database design but lacked advanced features such as handling missing data, optimizing query performance, and ensuring data integrity. As part of my ePortfolio enhancement process, I revisited the project to address these gaps and transform it into a more robust, efficient, and functional database system.

## Justification for Inclusion in the ePortfolio
I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my progression in database management and SQL optimization skills. The original version of this project served as a baseline, and the enhancements highlight my ability to identify and address practical challenges in database systems. Specifically, I focused on improving functionality by resolving missing data issues using the COALESCE function and introducing fallback logic for incomplete records. Additionally, I optimized query performance to make the system more scalable and reliable.

These enhancements showcase my proficiency in:
- **SQL query optimization**: I refined queries to improve performance and handle edge cases, such as missing or incomplete data.
- **Data integrity solutions**: By introducing fallback mechanisms for missing scores, I ensured the reliability and usability of the database.
- **Real-world problem solving**: This project reflects my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to address practical database challenges.

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process
Revisiting and enhancing this database project was a transformative experience. Initially, I lacked a deep understanding of handling missing data, optimizing queries, or ensuring database scalability. Through this process, I developed advanced skills that allowed me to address these challenges effectively.

### Key Learnings:
- **Handling Missing Data**: I implemented the COALESCE function and average calculations to resolve NULL values, ensuring meaningful and accurate results without compromising data integrity.
- **Optimization Techniques**: By analyzing query performance, I made changes that reduced processing time and improved scalability, showcasing my understanding of efficient database design.
- **Testing and Validation**: I learned the importance of rigorous testing to prevent new errors or inconsistencies when implementing enhancements.

### Challenges:
One significant challenge was balancing the fallback logic for missing data with the need to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the database. I spent considerable time refining this logic to ensure that it produced meaningful results without introducing inaccuracies.

### Course Outcomes Met:
- **Database Design and Management**: Enhanced my ability to create and optimize reliable, scalable databases.
- **Query Optimization**: Demonstrated advanced SQL techniques, including handling missing data and optimizing performance.
- **Data Integrity and Security**: Improved my understanding of maintaining database integrity and ensuring data recovery mechanisms.

### Summary:
Through this enhancement process, I applied new skills, solved complex problems, and demonstrated my growth as a Computer Science student. The improved artifact reflects my ability to adapt and refine a project over time, showcasing both technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities.
